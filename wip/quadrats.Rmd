## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
## Install packages if needed, attach them, and track/maintain versions in workflow

```{r, include=FALSE}
renv::init # to initialize a new project-local environment with a private R library
#reference for renv workflow: https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html
#my_packages <- c("renv", "easypackages",  "here", "ggthemes", "gridExtra", "tidyverse", "lubridate", "patchwork") # list of packages to be used in this Rmd file
#packages (my_packages) 
# checks to make sure the packages needed are loaded and asks before installing to confirm install in the console window
libraries (my_packages) # could be used in lieu of packages() if you already have the packages installed

```
##Confirm working directory for project
```{r}
here::here() # use this to work with sub-directories less awkwardly and share projects across users/machines more easily.
```
## Run this to update snapshot of packages when you commit the file
```{r}
#run as needed later in the project to capture required package versions
#renv::snapshot() 
#NB must respond and affirma actions in console or you will see the spinning wheel....
```
##Read in data *.csv data file
```{r}
rqs <- read_csv(here::here ("data","sfbay_rockweed_quadrat_surveys.csv"), col_names = TRUE) #reads in cvs file to tibble and keeps first row as column names
rqs <- mutate(rqs, date = as.POSIXct(rqs$date, tz = "America/Los_Angeles", format = "%m/%d/%Y")) 
# updates date$rqs formating from chr to POSIXct
rqs #shows first rows of tibble
```

## Convert zone character variable to factor variable with ordered levels
```{r}
rqs <- mutate(rqs, zone = as.factor(rqs$zone)) # converts zone to a factor variable (default order is alpha for characters)
rqs$zone <- ordered(rqs$zone, levels = c("Low", "Mid", "High")) # defines order of the factor
rqs
```
